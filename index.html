          <p class="lead mb-5">The study of consumption habits is a very hot topic, as it can be very useful for marketing issues, or advertisement.
            However, our goal here is to use data <b> in order to help consumers directly. </b>
            Through an analysis of the Instacart dataset, we aim to give the reader some advices regarding consumption to reorient clients’ habits toward a healthier
             way of life. All in all, we provide the first steps of a smooth transition to a more responsible consumption.</p>

          <p class="lead mb-5">Instacart is a famous american company that provides an online shopping service. They made their real data for year 2017 publicly available.
            This dataset consists in 4 different tables with data regarding the orders, the products and some categorization of the products. It also contains one dataset retracing the history of orders
             per product and per client, see <a href="https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017">here</a> for more details. </p>

          <p class="lead mb-5"> Exploring such a big dataset is a challenge, and you definitely need a strategy to dive into it. We thus chose to answer the following questions as guidelines:</p>
            <ul class="lead">
            <li>
            Can we classify consumers depending on the categories of products they buy (aisles and departments)
            and their repartition (fresh products, cooked meals, cans, …)?
            </li>
            <li>
            Can we define one of this group as having the “healthier consumption”, toward which people should tend to?
            </li>
            What are the consumption habits of consumers groups, especially the healthier one (day of the week, hour of the day,
            time since the previous order, number of orders, quantity ordered, reordering rate)?
            <li>
            Can we find equivalent products between the different consumers groups (by aisles),
            and thus offer healthier alternative products ? Which one should be advised, based on reorders?
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="mb-4">First Insights</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-5">Before answering the previously defined questions, let's have a look at meaningful general insights on the dataset. Such insights
          provide a good overview on users' habits.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto">
          <h4 class="mb-4">When do people commonly order?</h4>

                                          <img src="./img/hour_order.png" alt="Repartition of orders per hour">
          <p class="lead mb-5"> As could be expected, people tend to order during working hours (between 8 a.m. and 20 p.m.), and during the weekend.
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto">
          <h4 class="mb-4">How many times do people order at Instacart (i.e. : are they faithful?)?</h4>
            <img src="./img/order_numbers.png" alt="Number of orders per user" width="1000">
          <p class="lead mb-5"> Most of the consumers only order 4 times. None of them order less : we can hypothesize that we were provided
            with a dataset containing only part of user data, excluding too few faithful ones.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto">
          <h4 class="mb-4">How many products can one find in the Instacart dataset?</h4>
            <img src="./img/products_per_dpt.png" alt="Number of products per department">
          <p class="lead mb-5"> A large range of products can be found in the Instacart dataset.
            The classification into departments (further divided in aisles) makes possible the identification of similar products.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-5"> These first considerations being inferred, let's now move to the more interesting problem of users clustering.</p>

      <a class="btn btn-dark btn-xl js-scroll-trigger" href="#parag2">Users clustering</a>

  <section class="content-section bg-light" id="parag2">

      <div class="row">

          <h2 class="mb-4">Users clustering and healthiness score</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-5">We wanted to classify consumers depending on the categories of products they buy, to define a cluster of healthy consumers.
            It is a tremendous challenge, as there is no available metrics to quantify the healthiness of a product in the Instacart dataset.
            The risk is that a direct clustering on all available features won't differentiate between healthy and unhealthy consuming users, but rather between other
            criteria (consumers eating more salty or sweet for instance).</p>

            <p class="lead mb-5">Thus, we first applied a Principal Component Analysis, to reduce the numbers of features to cluster on.
            Suprisingly, the aisles accounting the most for the 4 first principal dimensions were all differential in terms of healthiness.
            More precisely, the first three dimensions were respectively led by "fresh fruits", "fresh vegetables" and "packaged vegetables fruits", considered to be healthy.
            The 4th dimension was led by "soft drinks", more related to unhealthiness. We thus chose to cluster on these 4 principal components.</p>




        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto">
          <h4 class="mb-4">Clusters visualization</h4>
          <img src="./img/clustering.png" alt="Clustering visualization" width="700">
          <p class="lead mb-5"> The previous representation shows clusters projected in the first two dimensions of the PCA.
            The three clusters are well defined, not overlapping, but the separation seems somehow artificially made.
            This is most likely due to a difficulty to really differentiate the users, because of the continuum in their habits.</p>

            <p class="lead mb-5"> Still, we can see tendancies emerging from the clustering, as reported below.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto">
          <h4 class="mb-4">Healthiness-related products categorize clusters </h4>
            <img src="./img/discriminatories_aisles.PNG" alt="Chi-2 score for aisles significance">

          <p class="lead mb-5"> This table shows the product aisles having the highest Chi-2 significance after clustering.
            As expected after PCA, consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables are really meaningful.
            Then the comsumption of soft drinks and frozen meals charcaterize unhealthy users.</p>

          <p class="lead mb-5"> Looking more precisely at the individual features of our three clusters enabled us to rank them in terms of healthiness.
            The most healthy one (referred to as cluster 2, purple above) is characterized by a high consumption of vegetables and herbs. It may indeed indicate a range of
            people taking the time to cook instead of eating already prepared meals.</p>

            <p class="lead mb-5"> The second most healthy one (referred to as cluster 1, green above) is characterized by a high consumption of fruits.</p>

            <p class="lead mb-5"> The less healthy one (referred to as cluster 0, yellow above) is characterized by a high consumption of soft drinks,
              bakings, snacks and candies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto">
          <h4 class="mb-4">No ordering habit is specific to any cluster</h4>
          <p class="lead mb-5"> We wanted to know whether different trends existed between clusters in terms of ordering habits : purchase day of the week and hours,
            time between two orders, etc. Our goal was to identify good practices that could be advised to the cluster of people eating a less healthy way. For instance,
            less time between two orders (indicating less meal planning) could have been associated with unhealthy consumption.
            However, there is no meaningful difference between clusters in terms of ordering habits and no good practice was inferrable.

           </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto">
          <h4 class="mb-4">Conclusion on the clusters and Healthiness score of a product</h4>
          <p class="lead mb-5"> Even if we didn't manage to identify good ordering practices, we have now 3 well-defined clusters, ranked in terms of
            healthiness. It is thus possible to rely on these clusters to characterize the healthiness of products individually and recommend better products
            to consumers. We can define the healthiness of a product as a function of the distribution (in terms of clusters) of people who consumed this product.
          </p>

          <p class="lead mb-5">For instance, if a "healthy" user consumes a certain product, it gives 4 points to this product.
          An "average" consumer would give 1 point, while an "unhealthy" consumer would remove 1 point to the product.
          Then, it is easy to adapt this (arbitrary) scores making a weighted average taking the number of consumptions into account.
          The bigger the score, the healthier the product.
          In particular, if a product has a score of -1, it means that it's only consumed by people of the unhealthy cluster, and a product rated 4 is only conumed by people of the healthy cluster.


          <p class="lead mb-5">
          Defined so, the healthiness score may however be irrelevant when a product is only consumed by very few people, because it induces a great variance in score evaluation.
          To deal with this limitation,  we chose to also take into account a product's popularity by deriving an Appreciation score for each product.
